           Titanic
In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lavett and his team on the research vessel " Akademik Mstislav Keldysh " on the deep-sea submersibles "Mir-1" and "Mir-2" sink to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean , where the remains of the Titanic liner , sunken April 15, 1912. They discover a safe that Lovett guesses should contain a blue diamond pendant , known as the "Heart of the Ocean". At the beginning of the 20th century, one Pittsburgh RothschildNathan Hockley bought it for his industrialist son Caledon, who gave the diamond as a wedding gift to his fiancee, Englishwoman Rose Dewitt Bukater, with whom they sailed on the Titanic to the United States, where they were supposed to get married. Caledon escaped, Rose died, and the jewel presumably went down with the ship. But, to the disappointment of the researchers, only soaked papers are found in the safe, among which is a well-preserved portrait dated April 14, 1912. Signed with the initials "JD", the portrait shows a naked girl with a similar pendant. Former actress Rose Calvert, aged 100, is watching an expedition report on TV and calls Lovett, telling him that the portrait is of herself. Despite the crew's doubts that the woman might well be an adventurer, Lovett agrees to meet with her, hoping to clarify the fate of the Heart of the Ocean. Rose, accompanied by her granddaughter Lizzy, flies by helicopter to the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. After appearing before Lovett and his team and convincing them that she is indeed Rose DeWitt Bukater, Rose begins her story and the action flashes back 84 years.
